  <p>Welcome to Project Tulpa, a non-governmental organization exploring the power and nature of consciousness.</p>

  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
  <div class="center-image"><img src="/images/digital-hand.jpg" alt=""></div>
  <p>
    In 1986, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States government, in cooperation with the Monroe
    Institute (TMI) and Itzhak Bentov, author of <em>Stalking the Wild Pendulum</em>, released <a href="">the Gateway
      Experience</a> - an
    official report on the power and nature of consciousness.. Core to its findings was the discovery that reality as we
    perceive it exists <em>within</em> consciousness, and that what we as human beings experience as dimensional space
    is in fact
    a hologram - conclusions echoed over millennia of subjective research conducted by various scholars, quantum
    theorists, philosophers, and spiritual leaders across a vast range of practices and doctrines. Through its
    experiments, the Gateway Experience scientifically established that consciousness-based, holographic reality can be
    manipulated through deep concentration and creativity - including the manifestation of thoughtforms into sentient
    beings inhabiting alternate non-physical realities. The explorer, anthropologist, and opera singer Alexandra
    David-Néel documented such a process almost a century ago in her book <em>Magic and Mystery in Tibet</em>. Her work
    extensively chronicles the practice of making tulpas, or tulpamancy - the Buddhist process of generating
    non-physical identities via mental projection. The practice she documented aligns precisely with the findings of TMI
    and the Gateway Experience. The dawn of cyberspace has seen a renewed interest in the practice of tulpamancy -
    within the last few years a myriad of Bulletin Board System (BBS) discussion boards have given rise to a brand of
    modern tulpamancy that approaches the digital world as a non-physical spiritual realm ripe for thoughtform
    actualization.

  <div class="center-image"><img src="/images/digital-globe.jpg" alt=""></div>
  <p>The five basic underlying tenets of Project Tulpa are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Consciousness is fundamental.</li>
    <li>Physical reality is a hologram.</li>
    <li>True reality is non-physical.</li>
    <li>Physical reality is, through concentration and creativity, malleable.</li>
    <li>Non-physical realms of imagination can become actualized realities.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Project Tulpa's core objective is the development of an integrated, interactive, and scientifically supported
    approach
    to investigating power and nature of consciousness. More specifically, the Project Tulpa aims specifically to
    explore
    the actualization of thoughtforms into holographic reality through the use of extended concentration practices
    (<em>meditation</em>), altered mind states, enhanced imagination exercises (patterning), and collaborative creative
    practices.
    The execution of Project Tulpa's mission requires the establishment of a core group of creatives and technicians to
    collectively imagine and actualize thoughtforms and the development of public rituals (<em>forcings</em>) to bring
    non-physical
    realities into holographic existence.

  <h2 id="eternal-september"><a href="eternal-september.net">Eternal September</a></h2>
  <p>
    The inaugural initiative of Project Tulpa is Eternal September, an extensive alternate reality consisting of a large
    web of interlocking tulpas. The initiative posits that the intermingling of multiple tulpas will have an exponential
    effect on the power and detail of the actualization process, leading to the full realization of an autonomous
    alternate reality populated by sentient beings and group entities. In accordance with the Gateway Experience's
    findings, Project Tulpa employs individuals with extraordinarily vivid and active imaginations in this pursuit -
    musicians, visual artists, creative technologists, computer coders, and actors - as well as scientists and
    scientific
    advisors from the fields of quantum theory, artificial intelligence, mythology, theology, and computer science.
    Eternal September participants are asked to delve deep into their subconscious in order to create tulpas that are
    reflections of their unadulterated thoughts and feelings, invigorating the process of actualization with passion and
    emotional resonance.
  </p>

  <p>Eternal September, in its current form, can be experienced via five portals:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Wiki</strong> :: a separate and discrete digital wiki system dedicated solely to the documentation and
      realization of the
      Eternal September world.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Patternings</strong> :: private, semi-private, and public rituals/events involving the invocation and
      documentation of the
      Eternal September reality. Some forcings bear a surface resemblance to performances but include a participatory
      "audience" in the ritual process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Installations</strong> :: static but immersive experiential spaces designed to provide direct access to
      the Eternal
      September
      reality.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Documentations</strong> :: documentary films, papers, and academic analyses of the Eternal September
      reality.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Objects</strong> :: the creation and dissemination, both private and public, of physical objects
      indigenous to the Eternal
      September reality.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Public access to the Eternal September wiki is available at www.eternal-september.net.</p>
